            In our class for today, after the tutor asked for any question from his prevous lessons and he got no response, he decided to give us a task to complete in 30mins.
        </p>

        <p style="background-color: #8ABAD3FF;">
            So i did my best to give him a summary for the bit i have learnt so far.
        </p>

        <p style="background-color: #d7816a;">
            And afterwards i will send my task to github, for his assessment. I am hopeful i got it right. For more information on this task you can also check my link in Github.
